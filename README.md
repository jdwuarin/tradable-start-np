tradable-start-np
=================
A starting point for creating tradable apps. Just clone and start hacking away. This starting point  includes code that:

* Places a market order and uses the client order id.
* Sends a pending order an watch for its execution
* Monitors the change in position once an order is placed
* Makes use of tracks and places orders on different tracks.

If you've read the API documentation on our website and want to start coding straight away using this project as a base for your app, here's what you need to do: tracks.
